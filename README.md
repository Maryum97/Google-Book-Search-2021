## üîç Description
This repository contains another one of my assignments, which was to create a Google Book Search using the very latest, popular, novel and sophisticated <b>React.js</b>  framework. This app has...

There are two main pages in this website:
1. <b>Search for Books</b> - 
<br>

2. <b>Saved Books</b> - 
<br>

Here is the link to the deployed application on <b>Heroku</b>:

## üíæ Installations
You can simply gain access to this repository after having created a Github account, and with the following applications installed on your local device:

1. VS Code
2. Git Bash/Terminal
3. Node.js
4. MongoDB Command
5. Robo3T
6. Insomnia

Then in VSC terminal, install some dependencies as explained in the 'Instructions' section below, and then follow all the other instructions as well.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Instructions
After installing the above, clone the repository to your local device, and run the following commands in the local terminal in VS Code:

> // to install the node modules
<br></br>
> npm install

<br>

> // to install react-dom, axios, and bootstrap, a few of the main dependancies (libraries)
<br></br>
> npm install react-dom axios bootstrap

<br>

> // to run the server in the browser 
<br></br>
> npm start

<br>

Once done, simply open the browser and view all the employees in the table. Filter out the employees by writing the first OR last name, OR their title, in the search bar. On clicking the 'Find Employee' button, you will be presented with the employees who share the name you have searched for. To reset the search, simply click on the 'Reset Search' button, and the page will load a random list of employees into the table again. Using the three buttons provided, sort the employees with the respective purpose of each button, as suggested by the names: 'Sort By Age', 'Sort Alphabetically', and 'Sort By Phone Number'. These sort buttons also work for filtered employees.

The same applies for using the app through the public link provided in the 'Description' section above.

## üíª Usage
This portfolio has been made far more advanced and modernized as compared to the last ones I submitted as a part of my course criteria. it has made use of very sophisticated programming tools, listed below:

1. React JS Framework
2. JavaScript for logic
3. Bootstrap/Reactstrap and CSS for styling
4. Axios library for front-end request, when my portfolio viewer fills out the contact form and submits it
5. Express, Cors, Nodemailer and bodyParser to handle back-end response in the server, so that the submission is received by myself via email
6. Dotenv to store sensitive information
7. React-dom from React libraries, for page connections 
8. React Hooks, for page functionality, in functional components

The app has been deployed using heroku.

## ‚úèÔ∏è Tests
There were no particular test that this app has been made to pass, except for the app to be running in the browser erroe free. with all the functionality taking place as programmed. The app is also responsive in the browser page, which means it is accecible on most devices.
